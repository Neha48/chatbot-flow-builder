# Chatbot Flow Builder

A drag-and-drop based flow builder built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/). This tool allows users to visually build message flows (e.g., for chatbot or automation workflows) by connecting and editing text message nodes in a simple and intuitive UI.

## Features

- **Visual Node Editing** – Edit message content via a settings panel.
- **Drag-and-Drop Node Creation** – Add message nodes from the side panel.
- **Connect Nodes** – Create connections by linking source and target handles.
- **Arrow Markers** – Visual arrows on edges for clarity.
- **Delete Nodes/Edges** – Select and press `Backspace` or `Delete` to remove.
- **Validation and Save** – Basic check before saving the flow.
